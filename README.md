# YouTube Channels Organizer
A simple extension for Chromium and Firefox-based browsers to organize your favorite channels into the categories you prefer. 
I created this extension because I wanted to view view latest videos of my fav creators in one place without having to go to each's profile or subscribe them. 

#### Notes and features:
- It fetches the latest 5 videos of each creator and shows them chronologically.
- It uses YT RSS to fetch the videos so might be slow and not updated.
- Since YT restricted the embed video being played (especially from extension), the video now opens in the new tab instead of the same tab.
- You can edit/delete/order categories you created or remove the channels from the category. 
- You can also import and export your categories in json.


> Disclaimer: Due to YT's restriction, the video plays in a new tab instead.
